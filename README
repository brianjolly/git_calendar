This is in a pretty rough "condept" state right now. 

Edit the go.sh script with your name, the path to your projects folder and a date range

Run go.sh in the command line
./go.sh

Sometimes go.sh prints out something like "fatal: bad default revision 'HEAD'"
I don't know what that's about, but everything should still work ok.

Then point your browser at the html file
